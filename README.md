# Summary
A full-day course covering the key concepts of how to leverage the R programming language for data analysis using open data. The course will cover the basic syntax of R as it relates to performing basic exploratory data analysis, as well as how to create impactful charts, graphs, and other information visualizations using NYC Open Data for operational decision making.

# Terminal Learning Objectives
+ Participants will understand what R is and why it's useful
+ Participants will understand how R structures data, and why that's different than Excel
+ Participants will open a dataset in R and shape into a usable structure for analysis
+ Participants will create a visualization and calculate summary statistics of a dataset in R
+ Participants will be exposed to elementary programming concepts and supplementary programming libraries in R
+ Participants will apply skills to conduct a simple analysis of a dataset from the [NYC Open Data Portal](http://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)
+ Participants will model how R can be used to build a data driven culture in their workplace

# Key Audience
Analysts working in city government with basic programming knowledge and/or experience performing advanced analysis in Excel (nested formulas with conditionals, PivotTables, and macros)
